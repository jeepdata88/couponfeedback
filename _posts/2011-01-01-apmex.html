I also appreciate the customer service representative's professionalism in asnswering questions I had about my order and he also suggested other metals that I may be interested and why these metals would be valuable to me. The checkout process is easy and it didn't take long for my metals to arrive. I don't buy bullions but instead small gold coins so I was glad to see that this website offered a good variety of gold coins from different countries, and I'm using them as a way to educate my children on the economies of these countries in general and how they affect the American economy. I'm a big fan of foreign currencies and I was especially impressed that APMEX had so many of them. For example, I purchased some vintage Mexican pesos, a few francs and vintage American coins. One thing I was impressed with was the website's customer service representative's professional attitude when I asked about some of the metals that were on sale at the time. At times the website seemed to be confusing because there were so many different ads for sales that I couldn't tell which sale matched which item was being sold. But overall I felt that the website gave me very accurate and detailed information the metals I was interested in. I especially enjoyed the silver coins of all of the First Ladies from over the past four decades, and I have them framed in my living room for guests to see when they walk in the house. <h2>What does APMEX do?</h2>APMEX is a website which focuses on the exchange of metals such as gold and silver.

APMEX has been featured on CNBC and different business magazines such as TIME, Fortune, Forbes and Money. APMEX's primary specialty is precious metals so there really isn't much to say regarding what they sell to customers. APMEX is the kind  of website that coin collectors would love because this website has every kind of coin you can think of. Some people buy and store these coins for the future as a financial investment as protection from financial disaster as a result of the weakening of the dollar, and they feel that gold doesn't depreciate, they look at this as security in tough economic times. But customers don't have to just buy metals, they can also sell them. Because APMEX allows you to sell your metals, you're earning extra income and that's one benefit of working with APMEX.
