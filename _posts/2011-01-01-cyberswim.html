Fraudulent companies often put fake testimonials and fake credentials on their websites so you especially need to be careful regarding this. Cyber Swim is a legiimate company and the fact that they're including the "about Us" and "Contact Us" sections on heir websites is a good indicator that this company is not a scam. And when you read customer reviews, just because you see a lot of negative comments doesn't mean that the company is a scam. It may mean that the company is legitimate but these products don't work for them specifically. Yet there are instances when negative customer reviews could signal the fact a certain company is a scam. If you feel you've been scammed by a certain company, you should contact either the Federal Trade Commission or the FBI so someone can be on alert about this company.
