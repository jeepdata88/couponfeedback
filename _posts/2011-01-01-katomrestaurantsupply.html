She was particularly happy with the wide selection of supplies that Katom had to offer. For example, when she purchased a new Kitcchen-Aid stand mixer from Katom, she said hat this mixer was affordable and her mixer arrived in a imely fashion. Most of all, she liked how the mixer worked. My supervisor also discussed the professionalism of Katom's cusomer service representatives. For example, when she received a faulty set of cookware from Katom, a company representative apologized for the error and immediately arranged for a new one to be mailed out. My supervisor also talked about the convenience of being able to order high quality restaurant supplies from her home and not have to stand in long lines at the store. The supervisor mentioned that a good friend of hers is picky when it comes to gifts, so the supervisor got her a gift card from Kattom, and the friend loved it. The supervisor also mentioned that Katom was one of the few places where she could find a large variety of Waring items, and she said that The Tupperware selection was fantastic. And the supervisor's husband who is co-owner of the catering company, said that he was glad to find a restaurant supply website that was affordable.
