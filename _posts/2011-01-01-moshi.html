For example, one of the commands told me what time it was while another command told me what time I set my alarm for. Another command on the digital voice-activated clock even told me the current temperature and I found this helpful because I can't always check the weather on TV due to my busy work schedule. This clock is neatly-designed and sleek, and I like the fact that it's easy to use. I can also choose from three different sleep sounds, and his clock even has a night light, which I like because I don't have to turn on my large lamp when I need to get up in the middle of the night. All I have to do is speak to this clock and it immediately recognizes what I want. It's like having a portable robot by your bed. I would recommend this product for college-age students who want a new twist on their alarm clocks and who wish to impress their roommates with new technological devices. this is also a good idea for the person who hates to constantlypush their alarm clock in order to get more sleep. And it's a nice product to get for your kitchen because it looks beautiful and because you can use this clock as a timer when cooking.
