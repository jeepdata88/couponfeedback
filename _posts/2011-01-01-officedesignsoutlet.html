But all too ofen many consumers get ripped off by online stores that are gimmicky and have no credibility. To be sure that the online store you're buying from isn't a scam, you need to research this company thoroughly and one way to do this is by visiting the Better Business Bureau's website and typing in the name of the company. Then read a few customer reviews and also look to see if any sanctions have been filed against this company for unethical business practices.

The website is easy to navigate and the checkout process is quick and simple. I appreciated the various discounts that I could receive on the office chairs, and the bargains were great. For example, I was able to purchase two chairs for about $300, and these chairs were of high quality. One complaint I had was that I wish this company sold more than office chairs because it's not fitting with title "Office Designs Outlet." I expeected to see more office desks, portable refrigerators, carpet for the office, radios and bookcases for office purposes and I was slightly disappointed. Another thing I didn't like was the excessive wait time when I called the customer service number and when I finally connected to a representative, he didn't know the answer to my question. With that said, I really don't have too many bad things to say about Office Designs Outlet. What I liked about this store is the different blogs which gave me advice on achieving good posture when sitting at the desk. This was important because of my family history I'm at risk for osteoporosis and I need to maintain good posture as much as possible. This store is especially good for those who don't need to buy a lot of office chairs for their companies and who are looking more for quality than quantity.
