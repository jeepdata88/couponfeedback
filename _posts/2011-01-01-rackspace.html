<h2>Is Rackspace a scam?</h2>Rackspace isn't a scam but there are online companies that may be fraudulent so you'll need to be careful. If a company makes excessive claims that are too good to be true, then it could be fraudulent. When you visit an online store you should see sections such as "About Us" or "Contact Us" because this usually means it's legitimate and that the company is honest in its' dealings. Also don't be fooled by the tesimonials you may see on a store's website because that doesn't mean a company is legiimate. If you want to learn more about the legitimacy of a company you can contact the Better Business Bureau and file a complaint against the company. One of the best ways to avoid being scammed is to shop from websites that you trust and are well-known. You can also ask some friends and relatives if they've ever heard of the company you're interested in and if so, if they're satisfied with the purchase. When doing business with a company you should never pay in cash because you need to be able to trace your purchases in he event a company rips you off. Many online business scams are subtle in their deception so if you see or hear anyhing in their ads that appear suspicious, you should beware before shopping with them.
