Revolution Prep is a company that offers you highly qualified tutors who can assist students in improving their academic skills.
<h2>5 Reasons to Try Revolution Prep...</h2>One good reason to try Revolution Prep is that you're getting specialized tutors who are suited to your child's academic needs. For example, if your child specifically struggles with math subjects such as algebra or trigonometry, your child will get a tutor that specializes in these subjects so your child can get better in these concepts. And this program's approach to tutoring is also pretty good. For example, in the reteaching method, the tutor will reteach the student the same concepts that the student learned in class but in a more effective way so the student can understand them better. With the exploration method, the tutor will show the student how to apply their lessons in various ways, and with the capstone method, the tutor will specifically help the student with a special research project that he or she was assigned at school. A second reason to try Revolution Prep is the care of each tuor for the academic success of the students they tutor. A third reason to try Revolution Prep is because of the decent prices of the tutoring sessions. Parents can choose from a variety of packages and the cheapest package of in-home sessions is $479.00. The average price overall ranges from a thousand to about three thousand dollars. A fourth reason to try Revolution Prep is because of the professionalism of the tutors and a fifth reason to try Revolution Prep is because after the tutoring sessions your child will improve greatly in his studies.<h2>Learn more about Revolution Prep</h2>The best way to learn about Revolution Prep is to visit their website and view the "About Us" section of it.

Another thing you can do is sign up for their e-mail newsletter and get weekly updates on Revolution Prep's services. You can also contact a customer service representative if you need specific details on Revolution Prep's services. Ask your child's teacher about Revolution Prep and if she thinks it would be a good option regarding tutoring for your child. If you know some friends or relatives who use Revolution Prep for their children, ask them if they've been satisfied with the results, and ask the children if they've noticed an improvement in their understanding of certain subjects. Sometimes education magazines such as Scholastic or Highlights may feature an article or ad from Revolution Prep, and if you attend teachers' workshops, you may find a representative from Revolution Prep there. Your Sunday newspaper is a good source of finding ads from this company, and occasionally you may see or hear commercials from Revolution Prep. If Revolution Prep sends you a flyer in the mailbox, read it then contact a representative if you're interested. If you belong to a professional organization for educators in your city, you can ask the organization's director if they've ever heard of Revolution Prep and if so, would they recommend this to parents for struggling children.<h2>Revolution Prep Review: Our Review of Revolution Prep</h2>I used Revolution Prep for my eight-year-old son who struugled with reading comprehension, especially when he reads longer paragraphs that require him to extract the main ideas from. I met with a tutor from Revolution Prep and he started the tutoring process by asking detailed questions about my child's reading comprehension problems, which I found very helpful. The tutor also had an enormous supply of study materials, and he gave a few of them to me so I can reinforce what the tutor taught while he's not at the house with the child. For example, during one session he took a voice recorder and recorded some main pointers for the child to memorize on his own time, and now he's applying these principles to his homework lessons and test preparation activities. Another thing I liked about this service was that we had access to the tutor at anytime. We were able to e-mail him when my child was stumped on certain assignments, and he and the child talked on the phone often while the child was reading certain essay questions that he couldn't figure out the right answer to. Because of the tutoring, my child makes better grades in reading class, and surprisingly he developed an interest in reading because of it. I was especially happy about this because he would normally enjoy video games more than reading good books. I would recommend this service to parents who want the best academic assistance for their children, and this program works.
