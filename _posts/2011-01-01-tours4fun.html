<h3>Tours4Fun Review: Is Tours4Fun a Good Buy?</h3>

<p>Tours4Fun is a website where you can get discounts and deals on vacation tours and more. We decided to write a review of Tours4Fun, to see what all the buzz is about. First of all, the website is very pleasantly designed and user-friendly, with lots of options for a first-timer to either “do it yourself” or be professionally assisted (there are contacts emails, toll-free skype numbers and such all over the place). </p>

<p>In reviewing Tours4Fun deals, it seems they are pretty good actually. The prices do seem incredibly low for the destinations mentioned. In addition, there are separate tabs for those who don’t fancy a tour but just want to book a flight, hotel, car, etc. In fact, on top of the advertised specials, there is a special tab for “Deals”, not to mention coupons for percentages off packages, referral incentives, and more. It beats paying full price at least.</p>

<p>I think the best part of the site, though, is the user-community interface. There are “Most Popular” links, discussion boards, reviews, etc. so you can see what other people who’ve tried the service are saying. There are even user photos from the trips. In fact, it’s a nice site just to get ideas from in the first place. If you’ve been putting off taking a vacation (or it never even entered your mind to take one), check out the site, see what strikes your fancy, and then sniff out a deal. Or maybe do it the other way around. </p>

<h3>Tours4Fun Scam: Is Tours4Fun a Scam Business?</h3>

<p>Tours4Fun is a popular website for people who want to find a tour at a great price. The site not only offers tours, but also stand-alone airline tickets, hotel reservations, and car rentals. However, when it comes to the net, we all know companies can look like a million bucks and end up being run out of somebody’s basement and in reality not live up to what it seems to offer. So is Tour4Fun a scam business?</p>
<p>A quick survey of the site reveals that the site is emblazoned with the Better Business Bureau and GoDaddy security symbols as well as a travel insurance company’s logo. However, one of the best indicators that the company is legit is the fact that contacting them is clear and easy (as opposed to shady companies which tend to hide their contact info or make it hard to find). In addition, the site involves the users, allowing you to log in, leave messages, give reviews, make recommendations, etc. The more real-life users involved, the less likely it is that a company is scamming you. Ah, the powers of Web 2.0!</p>

<p>So Tours4Fun checks out upon first glance, and seems like a great way to find a relaxing getaway at a good deal, share your experiences, and build a better site for would-be travel hounds or just the average person looking for a little escape from the mundane. The only caution appears to be that the offers may suck you in.  </p>
