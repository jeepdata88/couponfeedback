<h1>TrapCall Coupon Code and TrapCall Rebate</h1>
Trap Call is a service that lets you access blocked calls
<h2>Is TrapCall a scam?</h2>It appears that TrapCall isn't a scam but you should practice caution when visiting online shopping websites because there are many fraudulent companies which only seek to take your money while not providing the products or services you requested. If a company makes excessive claims that are too good to be true, more than likely it's a scam because these companies could be lying to you. Some fraudulent companies try to pressure you into making a quick purchase or signing a contract without discussing the terms of the agreement, and you should avoid these types of companies. If a company has a Better Business Bureau logo on it, then there's a chance that it's legitimate. Or if you see sections such as "About Us" or "Contact Us" on a company's website, then it could be legitimate. Visit the Better Business Bureau's website and type in the name of the company you're interested in, then read customer reviews as well as any complaints that may have been filed against that company. If you feel you've been scammed you should contact the Better Business Bureau or Federal Trade Commission if the scam appears more serious in nature. Some companies will even include testimonials as a way to lure potential customers but these are no guarantee that a company is legitimate so you need to be careful here. And in some cases fraudulent companies will even use a logo and slogan that looks and sound just like a well-known company you're familiar with.<h2>TrapCall Testimonials</h2>Customers who used TrapCall were very satisfied with their services.

Another customer complained that TrapCall didn't necessarily work on her Palm Pre phone.
