For example, if I wanted to buy a new turntable, I can make three to five payments in one month and own the turntable without going into debt by charging it on my credit card. Another thing I like about American Musical Supply is that the checkout process is simple and it doesn't take long for my products to arrive. I also enjoyed the weekly sales that often appear on the website. One issue I had with this website is that it doesn't have the largest supply of Yamaha keyboards and it's one of my favorite brands of keyboards. I was impressed with American Musical Supply's selection of drums and because my teenage son loves to play them, I bought some from American Musical Supply and now he practices on his drums daily after school. A complaint I have about American Musical Supply is that when I call their customer service number, an activated system comes on and I rarely get through to an actual person. I find it easier to send e-mails to them regarding certain items because they respond to you quicker. What I liked about American Musical Supply is that they show crisp and clear photos of their items and the product descriptions are detailed enough where I don't have to link to other websites to get more information on the products. Overall this website should be visited by music buffs and musicians who want affordable but quality music supplies.
