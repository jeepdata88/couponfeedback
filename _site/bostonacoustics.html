Sometimes a fraudulent company will make excessive claims about their services followed by false promises to potential customers. When you visit an online store for the first time, you should look for the "About Us" or "Contact Us" sections, and if these sections do not exist, then it's highly probable that it's a scam. And if a company charges you hidden fees to your bill without your knowledge, then you may have been a victim of a scam and you should contact this company as well as the Better Business Bureau about this situation. Fraudulent companies may even include testimonials on their websites but this is no guarantee that it's not a scam. You need to research this company thoroughly before making any purchases with this company. Fraudulent companies also try to pressure you into making a purchase on impulse because they're only after your money rather than providing you with a high quality product. But as for Boston Acoustics, it's a well-known and legitimate company and it offers a nice variety of good products for every budget and different personal tastes, and based on customers' testimonials, it's a really decent online store.
