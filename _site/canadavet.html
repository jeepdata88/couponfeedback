<h1>CanadaVet Coupon Code and CanadaVet Rebate</h1>
<p>CanadaVet.com is an online premium medication company carries premium pet medicine for less. They claim that when you shop online with them, you save a lot of money because you pay much less with them compared to how much you would pay for the same products if you shopped in the U.S. They carry medicines for fleas and ticks, heart worms, arthritis and joint pain, shampoos, washes, training aid, wound care and much more for your cats, dogs, kittens, birds, fish, farm animals, reptiles, snakes etc. </p>

<p>Are the claims made by CanadaVet.com true or is it a scam just to make some quick money? It was difficult to find too many reviews online from customers who have used CanadaVet.com. The few reviews were mostly negative. One customer complained that he got an expired product and his pet fell sick from using it. Other customers said that the products did save them money but it took too long to arrive. Some complained that they never received their product and canceling it and getting a refund was time consuming.  One customer said that he told his vet about the price that was offered on CanadaVet.com and his vet matched the price. Some recommended using other U.S based online companies like PetMed.</p>

<p>It is difficult to substantiate what people say online is definitely true, but usually if a majority has a negative or positive view it is generally thought to be true. CanadaVet.com may have cheaper product and if you are tempted to try them, order something small and see how you like it. You can get a coupon from icouponblog.com to save money.</p>
