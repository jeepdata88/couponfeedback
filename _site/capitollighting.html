This is not to say there may be some copycat fake website that appear to be like Capitol Lighting so you'll need to be careful. When visiting an online store that you're not too familiar with, you shouldn't immediately  purchase items from them but instead research the company first. See if that website is accredited by the Better Business Bureau and if you're unsure, go to the website of the Better Business Bureau and type in the name of the website you're interested in purchasing items. If a company makes outlandish promises about their services or products, you may want to avoid that company because more than likely this business is not legiimate. But based on customer reviews and Capitol Lighting's willingness to let customers know about their services in a truthful and professional way, there's a strong chance that Capitol Lighting is honest in their business practices. Capitol Lighting also offers a legitimate e-mail address and phone number which people can contact so this is further evidence that Capitol Lighting isn't a scam. Many scam websites may give you a false customer service number and e-mail address because they're trying to hide information from you. If a company tries to charge you extra fees in addition to the actual price of your product and you're not aware of these extra fees until your bill arrives, more than likely it's a scam.
