Fraudulent companies can cost you more money in the long run because you not only have to deal with unethically high costs for the company's services, but it's also costly to reclaim the funds you lost as the result of doing business with this company. Before you purchase items from an online company, you first should research this company to avoid being scammed. Look specifically for the "About Us" and "Contact Us" sections on a company's website and read them carefully. If the company's claims seem too good to be true, then it should be a red flag for you and you should avoid this company. Or if a company asks for an upfront fee before they start their services but they're not clear on what types of services you'll receive, then don't sign the contract because this could be a gimmick. Another good tool to use when researching a company is the Better Business Bureau's website. While on the website, type in the name of the website and look for customer reviews. Also find out if there have been any complaints against this company for unethical business practices. Online business scammers often try to pressure people into a quick purchase but realize that this is another method of ripping you off, and they should be avoided. But Entrust appears to be legitimate.
