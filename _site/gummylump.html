Gummy Lump also has some really nice wooden toys that serve a good educational purpose. For example, I'm currently using the wooden alphabet blocks to teach him the alphabet and how to spell out his first name. Another good toy that liked from Gummy Lump was the coloring books. My son likes to spend the afternoon using weird colors to color different picures in the book. One time he colored a pig blue while colored a cat black and green. Another toy that I like are the stuffed tigers. My son sometimes talks to it and puts a spoon of food to the tiger's mouth and pretends to be a zookeeper or doctor. And because his dad works for Amtrak, I bought my son a train set so he can learn about the kind of work his dad does on a daily basis. Now my son always shouts "On Board!" and "Choo-Choo" when playing with the train set. Recently our family attended his cousin's birthday party and we took pictures of the children. I was very happy with Gunny Lump's fun-colored picture frames and now my son has a few pictures of himself in his room.<h2>Gummy Lump Promo Code</h2>Gummy Lump doesn't have any special promo codes at the moment but they offer plenty of special discounts. For example, recently they held a "Toys Under $10 Sale", and I bought three toys which added up to ten dollars overall. This was especially a good sale because in recent years I found toys to be expensive and I especially like he fact that Gummy Lump's prices are affordable yet you can still get high quality toys that children can play with and improve their intellectual and practical skills with. Sometimes Gummy Lump will offer free play food as part of your purchase and I took advantage of this sale a few weeks ago. And if you have a purchase over $60.00, you'll get free shipping. If you want to learn more about Gummy Lump's upcoming and current sales on items, you can sign up for their e-mail newsletter or send an e-mail to the company's marketing department and inquire about the sales they offer on the website. When you look for bargains on the website, be sure to buy only the toys you think the child will like because you don't want to purchase items you don't need just because they're on sale. The sales on Gummy Lump's website help parents find the best toys for their children at low prices. If you receive brochures from Gummy Lump, this is one of the best ways to receive good discounts on their products, and you can order right from home.
