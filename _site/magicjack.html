I now have clearer phone calls and the calls don't drop the way they used to. I don't have dial-up Internet but my younger brother does and he was frustrated with always trying to maintain a good connection between his landline phone. I recommended Magic Jack to him and recently he told me he was very impressed with how Magic Jack helped him build a better connection to his Internet service. What I like about Magic Jack is that it's very small and it doesn't take so many hours to install in my socket. It's also convenient and I haven't had many problems with it ever since. Magic Jack's services are also affordable and it suits my budget prety well. Another benefit of Magic Jack is that you can get free voicemail with this service, which is a little cheaper than average cell phone plans that may charge extra for voicemail services. But a problem I have sometimes with using Magic Jack is that I'm not able to send or receive faxes but this is trivial compared the many benefits it offers. Another thing I like about this service is that I have caller ID because sometimes telemarketers like to call and tempt me with their many offers and I'm on a tight budget.
