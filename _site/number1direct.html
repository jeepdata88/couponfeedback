If an online store makes excessive claims that are too good to be true, than it could be a gimmick. If a company tries to charge you an upfront fee before they perform services or if they pressure you to accept their products, this may be a red flag. When you visit an online company, look for the "About Us" or "Contact Us" sections because this usually means that the company is a scam and it's secretive about their dealings. Sometimes a fraudulent company may use a logo or slogan that's very similar to one you're familiar with but you need to examine that logo carefully because you could be deceived. There are fraudulent companies whose workers seem to have good credentials, but they can also falsify records and degrees so you should verify these as well. And if a company can't give you the terms of service in writing, then don't accept the services. If you feel you've been scammed by a company you should contact the Better Business Bureau or Federal Trade Commission and file a complaint. When doing business with a company never pay in cash but instead use a check or credit card because you want to have a record of what you purchased in the event you realize you were scammed. Finally, stay away from companies that are very new or that you don't know.
