<h1>Phone Power Coupon Code and Phone Power Rebate</h1>
<p>Alexander Graham Bell brought about a revolution by inventing the phone. Another big revolution was brought about with the invention of the Voice over internet protocol (VOIP) phones. There is an influx of VoIP companies. Today we are going to look at one of them. It is called Phone Power. You can visit their website online at PhonePower.com.  They offer unlimited calling to the U.S and Canada, 45 plus features on their phones and a second phone line is offered for free. They also give you one hour per month of international calls and free equipment. All this for only 8.33 cents a month! You can get other plans by paying slightly more.</p>

<p>Phone Power sounds pretty good on their website.  But if you look at what customers are saying, it sounds pretty scary. Though on some websites it has received five star ratings, but there’s also lots of three and one star ratings as well.  The main complaint was the equipment not working and tech support providing much delayed service... A lot of the favorable ratings were from previous years and the unfavorable ratings are comparatively newer. This suggests that the company started off really well and made a great impression. But it is struggling to maintain whatever goodness it had.</p>

<p>If you are only looking for a cheap phone service and are extremely patient and don’t mind outages, breakdowns, then you should get Phone Power. You can get a discount coupon from icouponblog.com. But if you want a real hardworking VOIP phone with excellent service, you would be better off going somewhere else. The internet is full of options!</p>
