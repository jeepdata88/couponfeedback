So I now use Platinumtel Wireless and it's pleasant to use. I'm currently using the Paygo plan, which allows me to pay as I go, and it costs far less than the cell phone service I used for several years. Since I don't use text messaging often, I only have a limited amount of data for this purpose, and I can still talk unlimited on weekends and still pay an affordable price for my service each month. I like he fact that there are no hidden fees, and it's easy for me to access a customer service representative when I have questions about my service. Another thing I like about PlatinumTel Wireless is that I don't have too many pronlems with roaming or my phone calls dropping while I'm talking to people inside buildings. I would recommend this company to parents who want to get an affordable cell phone service for their kids, and this is also a good idea for people who don't have families What I liked about this service is that you can choose from a variety of phones from brands such as LG, Nokia, Samsung, Sony and other good brands. Customers should consider this service.<h2>PlatinumTel Wireless Testimonials</h2>Customers who use PlatinumTel Wireless were satisfied with the services.

Another customer menioned that she started using PlatinumTel Wireless as a way to get a cheaper plan but she especially likes the fact that unlike other prepaid phone plans, she can still surf the Web and check e-mails at affordable prices while still staying on budget. Some college students who use this service say that they were happy about the affordable text messaging rates, and that they can still get good ringtones without spending too much money. Another reason many customers enjoyed this service is because they don't have to worry about roaming on their phone or having to deal with dropped calls while on the phone. One customer mentioned that he liked the fact that he could still get the 411 directory with this service, and he was happy about the professionalism of the service representatives.
