<h1>Reimage Coupon Code and Reimage Rebate</h1>
Reimage offers excellent computer repair services
<h2>Reimage Review: Our Review of Reimage</h2>Reimage is a good website to utilize if your computer is running slowly, freezes ofen or if it has other problems. I operate an independent magazine, and all of us here use our computers heavily to write and publish articles and to design ads for the magazine. About five weeks ago we realized that most of our computers needed to be repaired after our computers kept freezing or shutting off for no reason. After careful research I decided to try Reimage.com, and they did an excellent job with restoring our computers, and now they work well. Reimage started by scanning our computers and they located a few viruses and other errors. From there the company restored all of our computers and it was done in a timely and effective way. Another good thing about Reimage was the affordability. Because I operate a business I decided to go for he unlimited pricing plan for businesses, which is about $149 a month. I also appreciated the professionalism of the customer service representatives and they appeared to be knowledgeable of their products. I would recommend this service especially to businessowners who use their computers heavily because you never know when an emergency will take place, and you'll want a company that offers immediate and quality service for your computers. This is also a good choice if you store a lot of files on your computer and if your computer is older than ten years old because the repairprerson may suggest new software.<h2>Find Reimage Deals</h2>The best way to learn about Reimage's deals is to sign up for their e-mail newsletter and browse the website in general for bargains. Or you can read your Sunday newspaper or computer-related magazines and find some ads or articles from Reimage. If you're attending an electronics convention as an electronics store owner, you can look around to see if Reimage has a booth and if so, ask them about any discounts they have to offer customers. Occasionally you'll find TV or radio commercials from Reimage so this is a good way to get nice deals from this company. Another way to get discounts from Reimage is to request a catalog from them so you can browse the sales. If you know someone who uses Reimage regularly, you can ask him or her about Reimage's services and if they've been satisfied with them. Online press releases from websites such as PR Web, Businesswire and PR Newswire may have some press releases about upcoming bargains from Reimage. Another thing you can do is ask a marketing representative for a packet which includes details on Reimage's services and pricing options. Sometimes you may get a flyer from Reimage in your mailbox and it could include some discounts. Another idea is to read some blogs from computer repair experts and see what they have to say about Reimage's services and the prices customers would pay for them. But when reading these blogs be careful because some blogs may be propagandistic in nature.<h2>Is Reimage a scam?</h2>Judging from the website overall, Reimage is a legitimate company but not all online computer repair services are credible so you need to research them thoroughly. If a company makes excessive claims that are too good to be true, then a red flag should go up. And if you don't see sections such as "About Us" or "Contact Us" on a website, it tmay be a suspicious website. Also don't be fooled by the testimonials you see or even the publications that endorse a certain company because this doesn't mean that a company is credible. Another thing you can do to keep from being scammed is visiting the Better Business Bureau's website and typing in the name of the company you're interested in. Then read some reviews about this company and find out if any complaints were filed against this company. If you feel you've been scammed by a company and the situation is serious, you should file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. When a person is scammed by a company, he loses money and time as he has to work hard to recover his losses and get law enforcement to punish the company who scammed him. This is why you should only do business with companies you trust and that have been around for many years. And when you do business with someone, never give a cash payment but instead a check or credit card payment because this way you can backtrack your payments effectively.
