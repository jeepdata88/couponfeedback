<h1>Revol Wireless  Coupon Code and Revol Wireless  Rebate</h1>
Revol Wireless is a service that offers affordable cell phone service to customers who are growing tired of expensive phone plans
<h2>Is Revol Wireless  a scam?</h2>While Revol Wireless doesn't appear to be a scam, it's imporant to be careful when you shop online because there are many wireless phone services that could be fraudulent. As with other types of companies, you want to look out for companies hat make claims which are too good to be true, and you need to see if their websites have sections such as "About Us" or "Contact Us" on them because his could mean it's legiimate. If a company has some nice testimonials on their website, don't be too certain that it's legitimate because fraudulent companies focus heavily on the testimonials but have little substance. Another thing you want to do is contact the Better Business Bureau if you're unsure of a certain company and find out if that company has any complaints against it for unethical business practices. Another way to protect yourself as a consumer is to only shop from websites that you trust and which are well-known. You should also ask friends and relatives about the company you want to shop from because they may know some information you're not aware, and this will make you a better consumer. Fraudulent companies sometimes use logos that look a lot like the real thing but really aren't so be careful in this regard. Another way to be an informed and safe consumer is to check for he Better Business Bureau logo on a company's website and you can also read reviews from mainstream publications about that company.<h2>A review of Revol Wireless </h2>I recently got a prepaid wireless phone service from Revol for my teenage nephew who is living with me, and we're both pleased with it. One thing I liked about this wireless service is that it works on a smartphone, which my nephew has. There's free shipping on all phone orders and you get unlimited texting at an affordable price per month. With a phone from Revol Wireless you also get direcory assistance, which I like because my nephew sometimes doesn't know the addresses of important places in the city, and he can use directory assistance to help him out. He can also download ringtones, and he has phone insurance should something happen to his phone. I was also glad hat Revol came with a voice mail feature, and he's happy to be able to surf the Web while on the phone. There's also no activation fees with this service or contract fees, which saves me money. And if telemarketers try to get him to sign up for a credit card, the phone's call blocking feature reduces their phone calls. There's also unlimited calls nationwide as well as long distance calls, and there's unlimited text messaging. The monthly price for this service is very affordable and it's better than other wireless services I tried. With Revol there is a wide variety of phones to choose from such as the Samsung Gem, LG Axis, Samsung Freeform and Samsung Messenger. Overall, Revol offers high quality wireless service at an affordable price.<h2>5 Reasons to Try Revol Wireless ...</h2>One good reason to try Revol Wireless is because it's flexible and affordable.
