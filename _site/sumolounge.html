The customer service representatives were also friendly and seemed knowledgeable of Sumo Lounge's products. A third reason why you should try Sumo Lounge is because of the wide variety of bean bags. For example, if you're a college student who is looking for a 1960s retro look to your apartment, Sumo Lounge has many odd-shaped and weird colored bean bags to choose from. And for the person who wants a really large bean bag that can serve as a daybed, you'll find this at Sumo Lounge. A fourth reason why you should try Sumo Lounge is because you get access to trendy furniture for your home, and you can get this at really affordable prices.<h2>A review of Sumo Lounge</h2>I recently purchased two bean bags to put in my guest room since my younger sister and four college-age cousins always visit during Christmas, Thanksgiving or the summer. When they come over they always sit in he bean bags, and they occasionally make a mess while sitting in them and eating them at the same time, but what I like about these bags is that they're easy to clean and maintain. The bean bags are also affordable and he ones I just bought were on sale for $39.99, which was a clearance price. I was impressed with the professional attitude of customer service representatives and how they were knowlwledgeable of the company's products. Another good benefit of Sumo Lounge is that you get to have advanced notification of upcoming sales so you can take advantage of the good sales Sumo Lounge has to offer. Another good thing about Sumo Lounge is that you'll usually get a timely order of your products. In addition, Sumo Lounge has  gift cards for you to give to loved ones who are picky when it comes to gifts. I especially liked the various designs of bean bags that Sumo Lounge has. For example, I purchased a bean bag that looked like a disco ball and I gave his to my older brother as a gift. What I like about Sumo Lounge is the funny title of this company. The company has nothing to do with sumo wrestling accessories or clothing but sells Sumo-sized furniture.
